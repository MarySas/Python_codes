# Python codes
Project in Python. Displays the codes that I worked on during my Career Foundry Data Analyst Course

## Instacart Project
Instacart is a online grocery store that operates through an app. They are willing to uncover sales patterns in a database. 
As a data analyst I want to answer the purchase behaviour and the profile of Instacart customers.
